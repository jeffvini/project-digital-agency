## 🛠️ Technical Highlights & Engineering

In this project, I prioritized writing clean, modular, and high-performance code. Below are the main pillars of the implementation:

* **Design Tokens (Primitive and Semantic):** Implementation of a structured CSS variables (Custom Properties) system. I separated raw values (primitives) from their logical applications (semantics), facilitating maintenance and visual consistency throughout the project.
* **BEM Methodology (Block Element Modifier):** CSS organized following the BEM pattern, ensuring the code is modular, scalable, and free from specificity conflicts.
* **Reusable CSS Architecture:** Reutilization of global components (such as FAQ, Headers, and Footers) to ensure styles are shared across pages, reducing code duplication.
* **Semantic HTML5 & Accessibility (A11y):** Rigorous use of semantic tags and ARIA attributes to ensure content is correctly interpreted by screen readers and search engines (SEO).
* **Advanced Responsive Design:** Implementation of a fluid layout system using Flexbox and Grid Layout throughout the project. The site was built with an adaptive approach, ensuring that everything from complex double-column grids to individual components intelligently restructures across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, prioritizing readability and maximum screen utilization at any resolution.
